                        Barleymap was designed to search the genetic and physical positions of barley markers on
                        the <strong>Barley Physical Map</strong> (IBSC<sup>[1]</sup>) and
                        the <strong>POPSEQ</strong> map<sup>[2]</sup>. The strong>Morex Genome</strong><sup>[3]</sup> map
                        was subsequently added in 2017. The current version uses the <strong>MorexV3</strong><sup>[5]</sup> by default.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Barleymap provides <strong>three tools</strong> to retrieve data from the maps:

                        <br/>
                        
                        The "Find markers" tool allows searching for loci which are commonly used by the barley community.
                        These loci include genetic markers, genes, BAC contigs, WGS contigs, etc. from different <strong>datasets</strong>.
                        Their map positions have been previously computed and stored, so that the users can retrieve
                        them by providing the identifier of the locus.
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        Be aware that "Find markers" datasets were generated using <strong>fixed parameters</strong>.
                        In those cases when the user wants to perform a more specific search, 
                        e.g. by choosing the alignment tool or parameters, 
                        it is recommended to get the FASTA sequence of the query and use the "Align sequences" tool instead.
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        As <strong>input data</strong>, the user must provide a list of identifiers to use as queries. Besides that,
                        the user needs to choose which is the <strong>map</strong> (or maps) from which to obtain the positions,
                        using the selection list "Choose maps".
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        The "Genes/Markers enrichment" area allows the user to customize which <strong>additional data</strong> will be output along
                        with the map positions of queries. First, the user can choose whether to show "genes", "markers" and/or "anchored".
                        The last usually refers to WGS contigs, BAC contigs, or other elements associated to map positions (anchored), 
                        but which lack a biological meaning per se.
                        Besides that, the user can also choose whether to "show only main features" for each map.
                        For example, for Morex Genome, "HORVU" genes are configured as "main" whereas "MLOCs" are not.
                        The "Add features" option involves 2 ways to add additional data to the results:
                        
                        <ul class="help_list">
                            <li>
                            "on markers": the additional data is searched for each marker independently.
                            Each additional row is appended after the query position.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                            "on intervals": the additional data is searched in the regions defined by all the queries.
                            Each additional row is added only once, and in its actual position in relation to the queries.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        Therefore, the "on markers" option is better to obtain detailed data associated to each query,
                        whereas the "on intervals" option is better to obtain a map-like result.
                        Note that both previous options show additional data in the same position as queries by default.
                        To obtain additional data around the markers the "Extend genes/markers search" option
                        must be activated and the interval, in cM or bp, depending on the value of the "Sort by" option (see below), should be adjusted.
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        <strong>Other parameters</strong> include whether to show or not markers with multiple mappings,
                        whether to sort the output by centimorgans (cM) or basepairs (bp), and an option to send the results to an email address provided by the user.
                        Note that the option "Sort by" will be applied only for IBSC2012, which has both cM and bp positions available.
                        POPSEQ data will be always sorted by cM, and Morex Genome data by bp.

                        The "Align sequences" tool allows searching the map position of <strong>FASTA formatted sequences</strong> through alignment.
                        This process is slower than "Find markers", but allows adjusting the alignment parameters as needed and searching
                        for any DNA sequences.
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        Some of the features of "Align sequences" are:

                            Barleymap results are map positions, which may come from different sequence references,
                            which are searched in a pan-genome or multi-reference fashion.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                            It allows using different alignment algorithms, what makes possible to search for sequences with and without introns.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                            Most of the details of this process are hidden from the user, who is interested only in the map and its map positions.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        As such, most of the <strong>parameters</strong> are the equivalent to those explained for the "Find markers" tool above.
                        As in "Find markers", the user has to choose a <strong>map</strong> (or maps). Note that when the user chooses a map, he is actually choosing
                        all the <strong>sequence references</strong> associated to that map (in the internal Barleymap configuration),
                        as references for performing the alignments.

                        In "Align sequences" the user can choose different options for the <strong>alignment algorithm</strong>,
                        under the option "Choose an action".

                            cdna: it is the recommended option, specially when all the queries come from sequences which could have introns.
                            For example, those from CDS or from markers produced from RNAseq data. All the alignments are performed
                            using the GMAP aligner<sup>[12][4]</sup>.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                            genomic: it uses the most popular alignment tool, BLASTN<sup>[13][3]</sup>, to perform all the alignments.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                            auto: every query is searched with GMAP. For those queries without hits, the search is repeated with BLASTN.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        Note that the user can choose also the parameters which define minimum thresholds for results of alignment to be reported.
                        The <strong>minimum identity</strong> of alignment can be set with the "min. id." parameter,
                        whereas the <strong>minimum query coverage</strong> in the alignment
                        can be set with the "min. query cov." parameter.
                        Any alignment result with one of those parameters smaller than the thresholds will be discarded by barleymap and thus not reported in
                        the output tables.

                        Besides that, Barleymap is able to use 3 different algorithms when searching maps which have more than one
                        database associated to it. The details of how these algorithms work can be found

                                an <strong>"exhaustive" algorithm</strong> (see Figure below) is used.
                                First, the queries are aligned against the first reference, using GMAP, BLASTN or both
                                depending on the aligner chosen (see above discussion about parameters of "Align sequences").
                                For every query with a hit in the reference a map position is retrieved.
                                Those queries without a map position are searched in the second reference.
                                This is repeated until all the queries have a map position or all the references have
                                been used once as reference.
                                The order in which databases are used as alignment target is the same as in the list above.

                            The first result shown by Barleymap is a <strong>graphical representation</strong> of the seven barley chromosomes.
                            Queries with map position are shown on top of those chromosomes.
                            Using the magnifying glass button, the user can toggle between complete chromosomes or just the mapped region.
